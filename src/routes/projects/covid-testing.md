The website provided real-time updates on the waiting times at the COVID-19 testing sites near you. It allowed users to enter their address or allow location permissions to find the nearest sites, and reported back their waiting times. Once a user arrived at a site, they could check into the queue, which would then alter the queue length and wait time, until they checked out - which reported back an accurate time measurement.

It also had an admin portal that allowed authorised users to modify the sites detais, such as opening hours.
