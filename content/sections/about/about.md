<u>Aspiring Developer</u> | Student at RMIT

Currently studying information technology, I am seeking new skills and experience to add to my arsenal. I strive to have an impact on teams I work with, whether leading or collaborating.

I enjoy front end development, exploring new hardware, creating and delivering solutions. 

Outside of tech, you'll find me skiing.
