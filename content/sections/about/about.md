I'm a software developer with a focus on front end development.

Currently studying information technology at RMIT, I am seeking new skills and experience to add to my arsenal. I strive to have an impact on teams I work with.

I enjoy exploring new hardware, Formula One and AFL. 

Outside of work, you'll find me skiing.
