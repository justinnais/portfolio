Clone of [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com) built with Svelte. Primary goal was to learn Svelte and see what all the hype was about.

Svelte made this project super simple with it's two-way data bindings, event listeners, and animations. All of which require much more boilerplate and complexity in React.

Planning on coming back to rework it with SvelteKit, tidy up mistakes I made initially when learning Svelte, and flesh out some features like accounts, statistics and theming.
