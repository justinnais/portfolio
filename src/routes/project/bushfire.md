summary: 'React dashboard for the CSIRO Decision Support System, helping present vital information to aid bushfire evacuations'
---

The Evacuation Modelling Decision Support System (DSS) is a software application that is intended as an aid to:

- Carry out a preliminary analysis of the potential impact of a predicted hazard on a road network
- Design an evacuation scenario to be simulated
- Run an evacuation simulation
- Visualize the outcome of the simulated evacuation and produce summary results

Our teams responsibility was to create a dashboard to display the results of the MATsim evacuation scenario, with the goal of assisting users in making the best possible decision from a quick glance.
